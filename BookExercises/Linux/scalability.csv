scaling up, adding more resources to the existing nodes like adding RAM .. storage or processing power
scaling out, adding more nodes to support more users
cluster, group of computers that can individualy run a software..utilized to achieve high availability for a server software
availability, the ability of the application user to access the system
availability, expressed as the percentage of uptime in a given year
high availability, application will be available without interruption
app server cluster, group of machines that can run an application server that can be reliably utilized with a minimum of down-time
database server cluster, a database server cluster is a group of machines that can run a database server that can be reliably utilized with a minimum of down-time
middle tier clustering, cluster that is used for service the middle tier in an application
application middle tier, logic tier that coordinates the application..process commands..makes logical decisions..evaluations..and performs calcualtions
logic tier, also know as the application middle tier in three-tier architecture
presentation tier, top tier user interface in an applcation
data tier, information is stored or retrieved from this tier in a three tier architecture
Load Balancing, technique for distributing workloads across multiple machines or clusters
Round Robin, load balancing algorithm where request is divided in cirular order to ensure all machines get equal number of requests and no single machine is overloaded
Session Affinity, load balancing techinique that requires a user session to be always served by an allocated machine
Sticky Session, In a load balanced server application where user info is stored in session it will be required to keep the session data available to all machines. This can be avaoided by always serving a partiular user session request from one machine 
IP Address Affinity, The client IP address is associated with a server node and all requests from a client IP are served by that one node
Optimize resource usage and Achieve Maximum Throughput and Minimize response time, Purpose of Load Balancing
Fail Over, Switching to another machine when one machine fails
Heart Beat Check, Load balancer checks target machine for signal and if none it redirects to another machine or cluster
Session Replication, Used in application server clusters to achieve session failover by replicating a user session to other machines every time a sessions data changes
Session Persistence with shared file system, method of session replication that includes saving session to a shared file system
Session Persisitence with shared database, Session replication technique that allows all machines in a cluster to be able to access the persisted session from the shared database system
In-memory replication, session replication technique that creates an in memory copy of the session in all the cluster nodes
CAP Theorem, it is not possible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: Consitency .. Availability .. Partition Tolerance
Consistency, all nodes see the same data even at the same time with concurrent updates
Availability, guarantee that every request recieves a response about whether it was successful or failed
Partition Tolerance, System continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system
Sharding, architectural approach that distributes a single logical database system into a cluster of machines is a horizontal partitioning design scheme
Horizontal Partitioning Design Scheme, rows of the database are stored seperately instead of in columns and each partition is called a shard
Consistent hashing, approach for creating shards by using unique id(user id) in the application
ACID Property, Property that defines relation databases as being Atomic..Consistent..Isolated and Durable
Atomicity property, ACID property that guarantees that if one part of a transaction fails the entire transaction will fail
Consistency property, ACID property that ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another
Isolation property, ACID property that ensure the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained had the transaction been executed serially
Durability property,ACID property where once a transaction has been committed it will remain so even in the event of power loss.
BASE property,Properties that define NoSQL databases as being Bascially Available .. Soft State and Eventually Consistent.
Basically Available Property,property that indicates that a NoSQL system is guaranteed to be available
Soft State Property,property of NoSQL DB where the state may change over time even without input
Eventual Consistency, system will be consisten over time given that the system doesn't recieve input during that time
Shared Nothing Architecture, Distributed computing approach in which each node is independent and self-sufficient and there is no single point of contention required across the system
Linear Scalability, an appliction that scale just by adding more machines without changing the application code
Distributed Lock Manager, runs in every machine in a cluster with identical copy of a cluster wide lock databse to provide software applications with a means to synch their shared resource
Course Grained Synchronization, use a simple lock to guard many object instances or even a whole subsystem of a program
Deadlock, when two threads are trying to access a locked resource that the other is holding
Remote Procedure Call (RPC), computer program that causes a procedure to execute in a different address space which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call.
Client Caching, keeps files in local cache memory of the workstation to reduce number of times the workstation needs to access the server
